How to use... (i think)

drag and drop the .fbx file into whatever game engine (using unity as an example)
place the matching .png texture into the same folder
unity should automatically assign the image onto the flag but if it doesnt...
open the model in the inspector
find the material named "flag_australia"
manually assign the correct PNG to the base colour slot

in the screenshots used i have used emmissions which could also be assigned to whatever game engine so long as
its supports emmissions

here is the colours used for the textures:

Base - #9DAFCF  intensity - 2.0
Pole - #FFFFFF  intensity - 1.5
Outline - #000000 intensity - 1.5

feel free to tweak it to however you like.
